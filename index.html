          <h2>HI, I'M STEPHAN <strong>SALVANT</strong></h2>
            <hr>
            <p>I am a software developer living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
            <p>As someone who traveled extensively for work, I'm interested in:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Experiencing different cultures</li>
                <li>Food, food, and more food</li>
                <li>And the concept of continuing to travel while working remotely</li>            
              </ul>
            <p>Please take a minute to view my webpage and feel free to <a href ="mailto:stephansalvant@gmail.com">Email Me!</a></p>

          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>After graduating college with a bachelors in graphic design, I worked as a graphic and web designer for a short period before I joined the military. After four years in the military, I began working as a defense contractor where I was able to pursue my passion for travel.</p> 
          
          <p> After working within the military in a team environment, I'm excited to shift gears and collaborate with others in doing what I love most - building/designing websites and software. A lot has changed in the last ten years and it's exciting to see how much the industry has grown.</p>

          <p> Outside of coding and travel, I really enjoy music, photography, and culinary arts. Although I've started quite late, I'm learning piano, and trying my best to cook some of my favorite dishes from the places I've visted.</p>
