				<h2>HI, I'M STEPHAN <strong>SALVANT</strong></h2>
        <hr>
        <p>I am a software developer living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
        <p>As someone who traveled extensively for work, I'm interested in:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Experiencing different cultures</li>
            <li>Food, food, and more food</li>
            <li>And the concept of continuing to travel while coding remotely</li>            
          </ul>
        <p>Please take a minute to view my webpage and feel free to <a href ="mailto:stephansalvant@gmail.com">Email Me!</a></p>

          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>After graduating college with a bachelors in graphic design, I worked as a graphic and web designer for a short period before I joined the military for a multitude of reasons . After four years in the military, I began working as a government contractor where I pursued my passion for travel and experiencing different cultures with work.</p> 
          
          <p> After ten years of working with the military, I'm ready to return to doing what I love most, building/designing websites, and whatever comes next. A lot has changed in the last ten years and it's exciting to see what web developers have to offer nowadays.</p>
