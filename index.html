          <h1>HI, I'M STEPHAN <strong>SALVANT</strong></h1>
            <hr>
            <p>I am a software developer living in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.</p>
            <p>As someone who traveled extensively for work, I'm interested in:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Experiencing different cultures</li>
                <li>Food, food, and more food</li>
                <li>And the concept of continuing to travel while working remotely</li>            
              </ul>
            <p>Please take a minute to view my webpage and feel free to <a href ="mailto:stephansalvant@gmail.com">Email Me!</a></p>

          <h2>ABOUT</h2>
          <hr>
          <p>After graduating college with a bachelors in graphic design, I worked as a graphic and web designer for a short period before I joined the military. After four years in the military, I began working as a defense contractor where I was able to pursue my passion for travel</p> 
          
          <p> After ten years of working with the military, I've returned to doing what I love most, building/designing websites. A lot has changed in the last ten years and it's exciting to see how much the industry has grown.</p>
